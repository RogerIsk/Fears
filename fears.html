    <h1>Alienophobia: Fear of Aliens</h1>
    <p>Fear of aliens, also known as alienophobia, <br> is a specific phobia characterized by an irrational and intense fear of extraterrestrial beings 
        <br>or encounters. It may stem from various sources, including science fiction, media depictions, cultural beliefs, or personal experiences. Symptoms may include anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and intrusive thoughts about aliens. Treatment options typically involve cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques to help manage and alleviate the fear.</p>
