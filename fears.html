            <h1>Alienophobia: Fear of Aliens</h1>
            <p>Fear of aliens, also known as alienophobia, is a specific phobia characterized by an irrational and intense fear of extraterrestrial beings 
                <br> or encounters. It may stem from various sources, including science fiction, media depictions, cultural beliefs, 
                <br> or personal experiences. Symptoms may include anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and intrusive thoughts about aliens. 
                <br> Treatment options typically involve cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques to help manage and alleviate the fear.</p>
