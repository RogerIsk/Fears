        <h1>Alienophobia: Fear of Aliens</h1>
        <p>
          Fear of aliens, also known as alienophobia, is a specific phobia
          characterized by an irrational and intense fear of extraterrestrial
          beings <br />
          or encounters. It may stem from various sources, including science
          fiction, media depictions, cultural beliefs, <br />
          or personal experiences. Symptoms may include anxiety, panic attacks,
          avoidance behaviors, and intrusive thoughts about aliens. <br />
          Treatment options typically involve cognitive-behavioral therapy
          (CBT), exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques to help manage and
          alleviate the fear. <br><br><h3>I hope these images haunt you at night</h3>
